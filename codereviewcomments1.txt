We've talked about this in person, and I know you're changing things around to use pop(), so I won't comment too explicitly on what you have here. Your comments are generally quite good and descriptive about not just what you want the program to use and why. Though you're refactoring the poem function, there's still a lot of good, useable concepts and code in there that can be used in the new version, so good job so far.
