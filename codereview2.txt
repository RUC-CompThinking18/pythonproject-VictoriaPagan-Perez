One piece of advice I'll start with is not to separate your code into separate files by code check: build the code commit by commit in a single file. The code runs and seems to put out what you expect, which is absolutely fantastic. Great work there. I think at this point, it's all about adding bells and whistles: do you, for example, want to do something about the punctuation? One of the lines that I got when I ran the code had a question mark followed by a comma. That's something you could get rid of via regex. You could also, in general, think about ways to prettify the output: what's a good intro for a user to see before getting a poem, for example?
