# Comments
You had extensive comments throughout, and you had a great intro comment for the file itself that described the program as a whole and documented its use and sources.

# Code Quality
You did really well at keeping the code DRY by calling the same function repeatedly with different parameters and building the poems repeatedly on a timer. You also accounted for someone not entering yes or no, which is necessary for a good user experience. It would have been good to also restart the program for them rather than just having them reload the program, but this is a minor quibble.

I'll also say that the experience of running the program and its output were moving and the presentation was thoughtful.

# Ambition
You set yourself a large task and accomplished it in a relatively short span of time; there's not much more to say than that. Very impressive all around. This is work you should be proud of.
